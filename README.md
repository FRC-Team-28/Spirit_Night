Limelight contains chase method. Tune PID loops in limelight to get it working. Current implementation has controller 1 holding A button to chase, see teleopPeriodic(). Also I made kind of significant changes to Movement.java to get it to work better in autonomous modes, so take a look at that and consider using it in the 2019 code. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller for info on tuning PID loops if you don't remember how.
